			<h1>About My Blog</h1>
			<p>I love blogs. I love reading blogs. I love reading all about
				all of the experiences that people have and can relate too. It makes
				me feel less crazy for having the experiences I have.</p>
			<p>I have the privilege of sharing my life's experiences with
				several peers and young mentoress. for the the last three years
				those people have been asking me to start my own blog filled with
				all of those experiences.</p>
			<p>You will see that I am a pretty candid person about myself.
				Transparency is something that keeps me going. That is why I love
				blogs; it's a way for people to be real. So I have given in and with
				the help of my super computer-genius husband, Matthew, I am creating
				this blog for all of us. I intend to share stories about my history
				of addictions, my healing and faith, my marriage journey, the ups
				and downs of becoming a mother of two beautiful kids and more.</p>
			<p>It's called Full Disclosure because I intend to do just that;
				fully disclosure everything I have experienced. My life is both
				messy and wonderful. God has brought me from some very dark places
				and into some amazing blessings. Although I am sure to make some
				people offended or uncomfortable with some by sharing some of my
				experiences, I believe this blog will offer healing and freedom to
				some of you as well as myself.</p>

			<p>Discere mentitum definitiones usu no. At legere noluisse
				probatus his. Sed movet eloquentiam suscipiantur ei. Et vel ferri
				facilisi neglegentur. Novum delectus ullamcorper cu quo, quodsi
				everti omittantur ius in, usu et erat doming suavitate.</p>
